# web-scraping-articles
Create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. Scrape news from another site using Mongoose and Cheerio.

For this assignment, I will be attempting to web scrape job postings from Linkedin!

What the app should do:
```
1. needs to be able to scrape articles from a website
2. save those articles
3. save comments to saved articles
4. remove comments from saved articles
5. remove saved articles
```

The app should scrape and display the following information for each article:
```
* Headline - the title of the article
* Summary - a short summary of the article
* URL - the url to the original article
* Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. 
The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. 
Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. 
All stored comments should be visible to every user.

```
